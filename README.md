# TMDB_fetcher-French
A python tool using the TMDB Movie data base API to build French speaking Movie sheets and download posters on a local disk drive.

This tool is used to walkthrough a Directory tree (typically an external disc drive of Usb Key) and looks for movie files.
For each found movie is perporms :
* Looks for the TMDB movie data base and tries to find a French title matching the file
* Renames the file with the `<French file name> - <year>` format.
* Builds a description sheet, stored besides the file , name is `<film_name>_tmdb.txt`
* downloads the poster image for the film, stores is besides the film with same name.
* Builds at the root folder a glbal catalog listing all the found movies on the diretctory tree
* Optionnaly builds a Movies sheets document gathering all the movie sheets of the directory tree.

The tool is currently designed to fetch French language data (film titles, descriptions), and the outputs of the 
tool are in French. Howver, this could be easilly adapted to any languages as TMDB is an international data base.

A catalog can be established listing all the found files.
